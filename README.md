# Mesh networks from eSIM

If you need to extend a Wi-Fi signal originating from an eSIM network to mobiles that don't support eSIM, you're essentially looking to share a cellular data connection over Wi-Fi. This is a bit different from a standard mesh network setup, which typically distributes a broadband connection. Here’s how you can achieve this:

## Equipment Needed:

### Mobile Device with eSIM Support and Hotspot Capability:

- A smartphone or a cellular-enabled tablet that supports eSIM and can create a Wi-Fi hotspot.
- This device will use its eSIM to connect to the cellular network and then share that connection over Wi-Fi.

### Wi-Fi Extender or Repeater (Optional):

- If the Wi-Fi signal from the hotspot isn’t strong enough to cover the needed area, a Wi-Fi extender can help.
- Models like Netgear EX8000 Nighthawk X6S, TP-Link RE650, or Linksys RE7000 are good choices.

## Setting Up the Network:

### Set Up the eSIM:
- First, configure the eSIM on your device to connect to the cellular network.

###Enable Hotspot:
- Turn on the mobile hotspot feature on the device with the eSIM. This will create a Wi-Fi network that other devices can connect to.

### Connect Devices:
- Connect your mobiles that do not support eSIM to this newly created Wi-Fi network.

### Use Wi-Fi Extender (If Needed):
- If the hotspot's range is insufficient, set up a Wi-Fi extender to boost the signal. Place the extender within a good range of the hotspot and follow the manufacturer’s instructions to connect it to the hotspot’s Wi-Fi network.

## Important Considerations:
- Data Usage: Be aware of the data usage, as all the data consumed by the connected devices will count towards the eSIM’s data plan.
- Battery Life: Running a hotspot continuously can drain the battery of the device quickly. It's advisable to keep the device plugged into a power source.
- Security: Ensure your Wi-Fi hotspot is secured with a strong password to prevent unauthorized access.
  
This setup effectively allows you to distribute a cellular data connection (from the eSIM) across multiple devices via Wi-Fi.
