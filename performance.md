Performance and reach

## Number of Connected Devices
- Capacity: Most Wi-Fi extenders can handle 20 to 30 devices simultaneously. High-end models might support more, but this varies by manufacturer and model.
- Bandwidth: The more devices connected, the more the bandwidth is divided. If many devices are using high-bandwidth applications (like video streaming), you might experience slower speeds.
- Router Limitations: The capacity also depends on your router's capabilities. If the router supports fewer devices, the extender won't increase that number.

## Range Coverage
- Typical Range: Wi-Fi extenders typically add an extra 300 to 2,000 feet (about 100 to 600 meters) of coverage, depending on the model, the environment, and obstacles like walls.
- Environmental Factors: The range can be affected by physical obstructions (like walls and floors) and interference from other electronic devices.
- Extender Placement: For optimal performance, place the extender halfway between the router (or hotspot source) and the area where you need better coverage. It should be within the router's signal range.

## Tips for Optimal Performance
- Strategic Placement: Avoid placing extenders near metal objects, microwaves, or cordless phones to reduce interference.
- Network Management: Some extenders offer network management features, allowing you to prioritize devices or control bandwidth usage.
- Regular Updates: Keep the extender's firmware updated for the best performance and security.

These are general guidelines, and actual performance can vary based on specific circumstances and equipment. Always refer to the extender's documentation for precise capabilities and limitations.
